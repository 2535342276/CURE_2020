# Database Accessibility Data
## What is this repository?
This repository contains data for around 200 nucleic acids research database.
## Why was it created?
There's currently a lack of study on biology database accessibility. This project aims to change that; I make collect around 200 nucleic acids research database, with detailed information about each database, available in CSV format. There are also many databases that are not well maintained and are eliminated.
I hope that this will make it easier for biologists to know the average number of years of database existence, and the tend of biology database accessibility.
## Where did you get the data?
The dataset I collect is from the website of the university press of the University of Oxford, in the Nucleic Acids Research section. The published papers of database provide database's specific information.
## Data format
The fileds include the database name, database description, database URL, publication DOI, publication date, accessibility, current location, and citation numbers.
